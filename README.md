# Horror-Game
One of my first longer term video games. It's a first person survival horror game.

It's mostly a learning project, so it really isn't supposed to be top notch or something. 
Features:
* Item System (Non-visible to player, only stored in code)
* GUI in-game display console. This is used to give the player visual feedback for things like instructions on how to play or events
* Scene-transition spawns. This makes the player come into the scene where he last left, such as when entering and exiting the warehouse
* Terrains. Pretty grass and trees. Shaders are pretty ugly, but i have NO idea how to fix that.
