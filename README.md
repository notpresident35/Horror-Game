# Horror-Game
One of my first longer term video games. It's a first person survival horror game.

It's mostly a learning project, so it really isn't supposed to be top notch or something. 
Features:
* Item System. (Non-visible to player, only stored in code)
* GUI in-game display console. This is used to give the player visual feedback for things like instructions on how to play or events.
* Scene-transition spawns. This makes the player come into the scene where he last left, such as when entering and exiting the warehouse.
* Terrains. Pretty grass and trees. Shaders are pretty ugly, but i have NO idea how to fix that.

To-Do list:
* Model more scenes. This is high priority. Right now there is very little content, and almost no point in doing anything.
* Add monster scares. This comes when I have places for the monster to go.
* Add animations. Add stuff like an animation for striking a match and lighting the candle, or picking things up.
* Add more stuff to warehouse. Things like the candle, matches, more enviroment objects, and maybe a monster scare.
